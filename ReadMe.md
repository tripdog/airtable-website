# A simple web page powered by Airtable DB

The purpose of this project is to create a single page site that uses Airtable 
as the database to store and retrieve data. In this case, Airtable has been
chosen as a user-friendly solution for a non-technical client to interface
with it in order to make simple updates to the web page.

Node is used to serve the site and securely store sensitive data such as our
Airtable API Key. 

Additionally, I will be using Express.js and PUG to serve the templates for 
the page. 

I will record my learnings here:
1. Tailwind and Pug are certainly not a match made in heaven
2. Need to learn about expressions in PUG
3. Airtable is REALLY useful for the right project. I hope I can use it for something someday.
4. I have a bad habit of trying to access variables before they get declared, 
need to watch out for this.
